It's shrunk down so if you want to take in all the details open it up in a new page. I've packed it with all sorts of Kirby references, and it's lore related as well.</p><br><br>

Quite proud of this one as I never drew most of these Magolor forms before. I won the competition along with 5 others, and my banner was featured for a weak with the other winners :D</p><br><br>

She's quite battered and beaten up in the Fallen AU, and while it's not as good as my art now I did learn a lot about perspective while making it.</p>
